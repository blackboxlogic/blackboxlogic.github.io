# Ssehc
* Ssehc is a chess variant with normal chess rules played in reverse.
* Moves must be made such that if the game were recorded and played backward it would appear to be a legal forward chess game with an unusual starting position.
* The goal is to end the game with your pieces in their starting positions (or as close as possible).

## **Starting a Game**
* Setup the board with each king two squares forward from their normal starting position (white king on F3, black king on F6).
* All other pieces start off the board (they are "captured") and will be "un-captured" back onto the board throughout the game.
* White starts the game by un-moving their king. Players alternate turns after that.
* Each player's turn has two phases: un-capture then un-move.

### **Un-Capture**
* This phase is *optional* (unless noted in "Kings" or "Pawns").
* Place one of your "captured" (off-board) pieces onto the board at the location from which your opponent un-moved their piece.

### **Un-Move**
* This phase is *required*.
* Choose any peice to un-move (unless noted in "Kings" or "Pawns").
* Rooks, knights, bishups and Queens are simple (they un-move like they move in normal chess).
* See "Kings" and "Pawns" for how they un-move.

## **End of Game**
* **End**: Once you have all your peices on the board, if all squares in the first two rows of your board are occupied OR your only legal un-moves would take a piece out of its home position then during your un-move phase you may declare the game over by announcing "good enough".
* **Scoring**: Players get one point for each peice in its normal-chess-start-position and loose two points for each piece in enemy teritory (anywhere in the last two rows). The player with the most points wins.
* Resigning, or draw by repition/stalemate/agreement/50-move-rule are the same as normal chess.

### **Kings** (are Complicated in Reverse)
* **Un-Single-Step**: A king may move one square in any direction.
* **Un-Castling**: If your king/rook are in a castled position, and there is nothing in the way and you're not un-castling into, out of, or through check, then you may un-castle (un-move both the king and rook to their starting position).
* **After Un-Castling**: Your opponent may not un-capture a piece on their next turn. You may not un-move your king or this rook for the rest of the game.
* **Check**: You may end your turn with your king in check (and announce "check") as long as it can legally be removed from check before you're next un-move.
* **Un-Check**: You may not end your turn with your opponent in check unless your oppenent can legally remove themselves from check with an un-capture. A player who starts their turn in check must un-capture out of check.

### **Pawns** (are Complicated in Reverse)
* **Un-Single-Step**: A pawn may move one square toward its home row. This *prevents* your opponent from un-capturing.
* **Un-Double-Step**: A pawn on the 4th rank may double move two squares toward its home row. This *prevents* your opponent from un-capturing.
* **Force-Un-Capture**: Pawns can move backward at an angle one space. This *forces* your opponent to un-captured a piece. Force-un-capture is only legal if your opponent can legally un-capture a pieces.
* **Un-Promotion**: Any non-king piece on your last row can be swapped with a captured pawn before you un-move it (the old piece becomes captured). If the pawn can't legally un-move from that square, un-promotion was not legal.
* **Un-En-passant**: If your opponent's pawn un-moved backward at an angle from your third row to your 4th row, you may un-capture a pawn on your 4th row on the file their pawn un-moved from (and announce "en-passant").
* Pawns may never be un-moved or un-captured to their first row.

This game was invented by Alex Hennings in 2020. Consider taking a picture after each phase and reviewing them in reverse order after the game.
