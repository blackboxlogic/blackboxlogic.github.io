# Ssehc
* Ssehc is a chess variant with *normal-chess* rules played in reverse.
* Moves must be made such that if the game were recorded and played backward it would appear to be a legal forward chess game with an unusual starting position.
* The goal is to end the game with your pieces in their starting positions (or as close as possible).

## **Starting a Game**
* Setup the board with each king two squares forward from their normal starting position (white king on F3, black king on F6).
* All other pieces start off the board (they are *captured*) and will be *un-captured* back onto the board throughout the game.
* White starts the game by *un-moving* their king. Players alternate turns after that.
* Each player's turn has two phases: *un-capture* then *un-move*.

### **Un-Capture**
* This phase is *optional* and you may choose any one of your *captured* (off-board) piece to *un-capture* (unless noted in "help").
* Place your *captured* pieces onto the board at the location from which your opponent *un-moved* their piece.

### **Un-Move**
* This phase is *required*. You may choose which one of your pieces to *un-move* (unless in *Un-Check*, see "Help").
* Rooks, knights, bishops and Queens are simple (they *un-move* like they *move* in *normal-chess*). For kings and pawns, see "Help".

## **End of Game**
* **End**: Once you have all your pieces on the board, if all squares in the first two rows of your board are occupied OR your only legal *un-moves* would take a piece out of its home position then instead of your *un-move* phase you may *declare the game is over* by announcing "good enough".
* **Scoring**: Players get one point for each piece in its *normal-chess-start-position* and loose two points for each piece in enemy territory (anywhere in the last two rows). The player with the most points wins.
* Resigning, or draw by repetition/stalemate/agreement/50-move-rule are the same as *normal-chess*.

## **Help**
* King and Pawn rules are conditional and asymmetrical in *normal-chess* so they are complicated in reverse. They can add restrictions to which piece may *un-move*, where to, if the *un-capture* phase occurs and which pieces may be *un-captured*. These will be easier to remember and understand if you think of these as *normal-chess* rules (which you already know and love) played in reverse.

### **Kings** (are Complicated in Reverse)
* **Un-Single-Step**: A king may *un-move* one square in any direction (same as *normal-chess*).
* **Un-Castling**: If your king/rook are in a castled position, and there is nothing in the way and you're not *un-castling* into, out of, or through check, then you may *un-castle* (*un-move* both the king and rook to their starting position).
* **After Un-Castling**: Your opponent may not *un-capture* a piece on their next turn. You may not *un-move* your king or this rook for the rest of the game.
* **Check**: You may end your turn with your king in *check* (and announce "check") as long as it can legally be removed from check before you're next *un-move*.
* **Un-Check**: You may not end your turn with your opponent in check unless your opponent can legally remove themselves from check with an *un-capture*. A player who starts their turn in *check* must *un-capture* out of check.

### **Pawns** (are Complicated in Reverse)
* **Un-Capture**: Pawns may not be *un-captured* to the first or last row.
* **Un-Single-Step**: A pawn may *un-move* one square toward its home row (but never to the first row). This *prevents* your opponent from *un-capturing*.
* **Un-Double-Step**: A pawn on the 4th row may *un-move* two squares toward its 2nd row. This *prevents* your opponent from *un-capturing*.
* **Force-Un-Capture**: Pawns can *un-move* backward at an angle one space. This *forces* your opponent to *un-captured* a piece. This is only legal if your opponent can legally *un-capture* a pieces to this location.
* **Un-Promotion**: Any non-king piece on your last row can be swapped with a *captured* pawn before you *un-move* it (the old piece becomes *captured* and is removed from the board). If the pawn can't legally *un-move* from that square, *un-promotion* was not legal.
* **Un-En-passant**: If your opponent's pawn *Force-Un-Captures* from your 3rd row to your 4th row, you may *un-capture* a pawn on your 4th row on the file their pawn *un-moved* from (and announce "en-passant"). You must then *un-double-step* this pawn on your *un-move* phase and if you can't legally do so then *un-en-passant* wasn't legal.

This game was invented by Alex Hennings in 2020. Consider taking a picture after each phase and reviewing them in reverse order after the game.
